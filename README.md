# Joy of Cooking, Community, Crypto, and Collaboration
This is intended to be a collaborative experiment using existing and future web3 tools. The goal will be to create a permanent, historical digital record and physical print version of a Crypto Community Cookbook inspired by the classic 1931 cookbook, Joy of Cooking.

Ancillary goals include introducing more people to the features of crypto, gathering user feedback for the different tools and platforms used, practicing decentralized coordination, growing the adoption of decentralized marketplaces, and producing a replicable framework for decentralized publication.

## Overview
Using the Chapters in the Joy of Cooking as our outline, we will crowdsource numerous recipies from any member of the crypto community who wishes to participate. The goal should be to get recipes across the entire spectrum of the community. From maximalists to shitcoiners to traders to founders to journalists to lawyers to builders to noobs and everywhere in between. True cross-chain interoperability.

## The JOY Project - A lightnode colony ðŸ•¯
Colony is a tool for open organizations. It provides a flexible framework for groups of people to coordinate and collaborate on projects, communities, and/or businesses.

The JOY Project is a fun, low-stakes experiment that could, with a few tweaks, become the foundation for a number of subsequent projects similar in scope and domainâ€“e.g. pop-up events, recipe testing, a network of community gardens, open-source publisher, etc..


### Tasks
Tasks in a Colony are used to coordinate work and facilitate the earning of reputation. Completing tasks gets you paid and/or earns you reputation in the form of a token, in our case: [A Token of JOY](https://etherscan.io/token/0xd9fba6e4bcc44e3429ae4aea0fa480cb451f3ea9)

### Domains
The JOY Project is organized into Domains. Each Chapter has its own Domain.

Domains are a structure for compartmentalizing the work and shared resources of a colony into smaller, more specialized sub-groups which are analogous to the departments of a traditional company (or chapters in a cookbook). Given the flexibility of Colony domains, a colony could forseeably branch off into something greater than its initial purpose.

In addition to Chapter Domains, the initial base domains in The JOY Project are:
- Chef
- Producer
- Patron
- Designer
- Publisher


### The JOY Token
The JOY Token is the native token for The Joy Project. JOY is earned by completing tasks and/or contributing recipes, and represents a form of stake in the project. It could foreseeably be used as credit when purchasing Joy Project merch or bundled as an extra incentive in a marketplace.

Colony makes it possible for any funds contributed to or earned by The JOY Project will also be distributed in proportion to the amount of JOY each participant holds in their respective wallet.
