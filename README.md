# Joy of Cooking, Community, Crypto, and Collaboration
This is intended to be a collaborative experiment using existing and future web3 tools. The goal will be to create a permanent, historical digital record of the classic 1931 cookbook, Joy of Cooking.

Ancillary goals include introducing more people to crypto, gather user feedback for the different tools used, and practicing decentralized coordination.

## Overview
Recreate and make every recipe featured in Joy of Cooking and upload to IPFS so that a permanent record is created. Recipes are to be recreated faithful to the letter, and feature step-by-step pictures as needed along with the picture of the final dish. Notes should be added at the end of recipes.

One of the main limitations of IPFS is the hash address of pages change each time a page is updated. This won't be an issue since once a recipe is completed, it can in a sense be _printed_ to IPFS.

## Tools
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) - Hosting
- [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co) - Bounties/Technical Help/Kudos
- [Colony](https://colony.io) - DAO (yes, a DAO)
- [OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org) - Marketplace
- [Y'alls](https://yalls.org/) - Blog/Monetization (BTC)
- [Cent](https://beta.cent.co/) - Blog/Monetization (ETH)

## So, uh.. how would a Colony DAO work exactly?
Colony is a tool for open organizations. It provides a flexible framework for groups of people to coordinate and collaborate on projects, communities, and/or businesses.

A Colony based on Joy of Cooking would be a fun, low-stakes experiment that could, with a few tweaks, become the foundation for a number of subsequent projects similar in scope and domainâ€“e.g. pop-up events, recipe testing, community gardens, etc..


### Tasks
Tasks in a Colony are used to coordinate work and facilitate the earning of reputation. Completing tasks gets you paid and/or earns you reputation in the form of a token.

The base tasks in The Joy Colony would be:
- Recreate a specific recipe according to spec
- Provide or produce an ingredient for a specific recipe
- Upload completed recipe to IPFS and record hash in appropriate places
- Purchase Joy Colony merch and receive bonus JOY token
- Attend a special Joy Colony event and receive bonus JOY tokens
- Contribute to a Joy Colony Charity Food Drive and receive bonus JOY tokens

### Domains and Skills
Tasks in a Colony are organized under Domains. Reputation can be earned in various domains.

Domains are a structure for compartmentalizing the work and shared resources of a colony into smaller, more specialized sub-groups which are analogous to the departments of a traditional company. Given the flexibility of Colony domains, a colony could forseeably branch off into something greater than its initial purpose.

The base domains in The Joy Colony would be:
- Chef
- Producer
- Patron
- Designer
- Publisher

Skills are a similar structure that categorize the _type_ of work done, independent of the domain or colony in which the work took place.

Skills are shared globally by _all colonies_, not just The Joy Colony. Even though skills exist universally, reputation earned in the skill hierarchy is still unique to each colony.

I'd imagine skills in The Joy Colony would be more technical skills such as:
- Developer
- Front End
- Back End

### JOY Token
The JOY Token is the native token for The Joy Colony. JOY is earned by completing tasks, and represents the reputation earned in the colony. It can also be used as credit when purchasing Joy Colony merch, thereby granting it a monetary value greater than zero.

Any funds contributed to or earned by the colony will also be distributed in proportion to the amount of JOY each participant holds in their respective wallet.
