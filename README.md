# Joy of Cooking, Crypto, and Collaboration
This is intended to be a collaborative experiment using existing and future web3 tools. The goal will be to create a permanent historical record of the classic 1931 cookbook, Joy of Cooking.

## Overview
Recreate and make every recipe featured in Joy of Cooking and upload to IPFS so that a permanent record is created. Recipes are to be recreated faithful to the letter, and feature step-by-step pictures as needed along with the picture of the final dish. Notes should be added at the end of recipes.

One of the main limitations of IPFS is the hash address of pages change each time a page is updated. This won't be an issue since once a recipe is completed, it can in a sense be _printed_ to IPFS.
